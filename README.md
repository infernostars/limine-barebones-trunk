# Rainbows
Welcome to Rainbows. Rainbows is a work in progress operating system.

## Planned functionality
Rainbows is a command line interface.
Commands can hide the command line and take the entire terminal if needed, but a keybind [that hasn't been thought of yet] will close it.

## Minimum Requirements
x86_64 (or amd64, whatever you want to call it) systems are supported.
4MB of RAM is recommended.

## How to use
To use Rainbows, you need to flash a storage medium, such as an USB stick or CD drive, and then insert it into your computer.
Then, restart your computer.
Before your previous operating system starts booting up, press the key that opens the boot-device selection menu for you, such as Esc, F10 or F12.
Select USB stick or CD drive as main boot device.
The subsequent reboot should detect operating system.
When limine bootloader pops up, press enter to select the operating system or wait 3 seconds.
Rainbows should have loaded!

We currently view a setup program as unnecessary.

## How to install on a virtual machine
We recommend QEMU for virtualizing Rainbows. We will be explaining how to virtualize Rainbows in QEMU in the near future.
###VirtualBox
To install Rainbows on VirtualBox, create a new machine by clicking New at the top.
Name your machine whatever you want.
Set type to other and version Other/Unknown (64-bit).
We recommend 4MB of RAM. This may and probably will change in later build versions.

Then, click on Create a virtual hard disk now in the tab Hard Disk and click on Create.
If you already have a virtual hard disk file that you want to use, click on Use an existing virtual hard disk file and select one.
Then, change file size to a minimum of 100MB.

Select prefered hard disk file type and way of storage on physical hard disk to your liking.
We recommend Fixed Size for performance, but Dynamically allocated is better if long waiting times for creating a fixed size hard disk are unfavorable.
Once you decided, click on Create.

Now, click Settings at the top. 
Go to Storage.
Click on Controller: IDE.

Click on the disk symbol.
Click on Add. Insert your Rainbows .iso file. 
Now, click Start at the top.

You're done. 
If you encur errors during install, ask arenexu for help.

## Current functionality
* Currently, Rainbows only has a bootup message. 

## (Future) Commands
* `/help` shows all available commands and programs

## Precaution 
We want to further clarify that we are not liable for *any* direct, indirect or consequential damages regarding loss of use, data or profits. 
Rainbows is, so far, an *experimental* operating system. It is not meant for real use.
